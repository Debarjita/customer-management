# Employee Management System

This Python-based Employee Management System provides basic functionalities for managing employee records. The application uses MySQL as the database to store information, allowing users to add, promote, remove, and display employee details.

## Features
- **Add Employee**: Insert a new employee record.
- **Remove Employee**: Delete an employee record by ID.
- **Promote Employee**: Increase the salary of an existing employee.
- **Display Employees**: View all employee records stored in the database.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**
- **MySQL database**
- **mysql-connector-python**: Install it via pip
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
  ```
### Database Setup
- Create a MySQL Database: Create a database called emp.
- Create a Table:
```sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE empd (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    post VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT
);
```
- Update Database Credentials: Update your MySQL connection details in the Python code:
```python
con = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="your_password",
    database="emp"
)
```
